# Development

## Building the Source

I Used VS 2019 Enterprise, should work for older versions as well

- Open DCSSReplay.sln
- Select the project TtyRecMonkey and make it your startup project before running.
- restore nuget packages
- rebuild the solution to trigger the PuttyDLL build
- it should now work

## Project Layout

### PuttyDLL - MaulingMonkey, Rytisgit

PuttyDLL is a native C project which is takes the inner workings of the PUTTY.DSP project from the official PuTTY source code.

Key differences:

- It's been converted to a VS2008 project via the upgrade manager (which worked flawlessly)
- It's then been converted to a VS2012 project, which also worked
- It now generates DLLs instead of EXEs
- _*_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE have been added to supress warning spam from standard library functions
- export.c has been added which exposes methods for PuttySharp (C#) to PInvoke
- Other source files may be modified to expose more to export.c -- should be mostly cosmetic/making availbe outside the TU
- Overrided encoding check, to always output UTF-8, since DCSS TtyRecs are in that format
- Removed all of the platform specific code, all interface elements, leaving only the code needed to run it and decode the ttyrec data stream


### PuttySharp - MaulingMonkey

PuttySharp is a C# library which wraps the methods exposed by PuttyDLL for easier consumption in C#

It is currently small enough that it ended up well commented and designed.  This probably won't last very long.

### TtyRecDecoder - MaulingMonkey, Rytisgit

Parses Ttyrec files, prepares for feeding the data to Putty

### TtyRecMonkey - MaulingMonkey, Rytisgit, Aspectus

TtyRecMonkey is the main C# program which is the point of this project.  It is not well written.

It currently handles:

- Controlling the threading for individual frame generation
- Updating the main display window 
- Inputs from user

### InputParser - Rytisgit

Contains a Model that is used for frame Generation. 

Parser fills the Model with data before every frame from the terminal Character array that is passed to it.

### FrameGenerator - Aspectus, Rytisgit

The Big One - Takes all the custom rules along with the Model for each frame and tries to make an image that resembles what the screen would look like on a real DCSS game in that moment. 

Looks similar quite often.

Is just a bit of a mess in general.

### Installer - Rytisgit 
- Creates .msi installers for releases.
- Has seperate repository
